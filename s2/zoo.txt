A Tour through the Visualization Zoo: Los conceptos que me resultaron más novedosos, se indican con (*). Lo no indicado lo traigo para resumir el esqueleto.

Wealth of valuable information: find ways to explore, relate, and communicate the data meaningfully- Focus on comprehension, memory, and decision making.

Some general agreement: spatial position (as in a scatter plot or bar chart) leads to the most accurate decoding of numerical data

Exotic (but practically useful!) forms of visual data representation with common “DNA”

TIME-SERIES DATA
NDEX CHARTS
STACKED GRAPHS
	-does not support negative numbers
	-stacking may make it difficult to accurately interpret trends that lie atop other curves.
SMALL MULTIPLES
HORIZON GRAPHS *
	-Although the horizon graph takes some time to learn, it has been found to be more effective than the standard plot when the chart sizes get quite small
STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS: exploratory data analysis
	-STEM-AND-LEAF PLOTS
	-Q-Q PLOTS
	-SPLOM (SCATTER PLOT MATRIX)
	-PARALLEL COORDINATES *
MAPS
	-FLOW MAPS. Charles Minard’s depiction of Napoleon’s ill-fated march on Moscow - Visto en curso con TENARIS
	-CHOROPLETH MAPS
		One common error is to encode raw data values (such as population) rather than using normalized values to produce a density map. 
		Another issue is that one’s perception of the shaded value can also be affected by the underlying area of the geographic region.
	-GRADUATED SYMBOL MAPS
		Avoids confounding geographic area with data values *
	-CARTOGRAMS
HIERARCHIES
	-NODE-LINK DIAGRAMS
	-Cartesian Node-link Diagram - Using polar rather than Cartesian coordinates has a pleasing aesthetic, while using space more efficiently
	-indented tree
-ADJACENCY DIAGRAMS *
	-Because the nodes are now space-filling, however, we can use a length encoding for the size of software classes and packages. 
	-This reveals an additional dimension that would be difficult to show in a node-link diagram.
	-The sunburst layout, is equivalent to the icicle layout, but in polar coordinates.
-ENCLOSURE DIAGRAMS *
	-a treemap recursively subdivides area into rectangles, by packing circles *
NETWORKS
	- A central challenge in graph visualization is computing an effective layout. Unrelated nodes must also be placed far enough apart to differentiate relationships.
	- Minimizing the number of edge crossings.
-FORCE-DIRECTED LAYOUTS *
	-A common and intuitive approach to network layout is to model the graph as a physical system
	-Nodes are charged particles that repel each other, and links are dampened springs that pull related nodes together. 
	-A physical simulation of these forces then determines the node positions; approximation techniques that avoid computing all pairwise forces enable the layout of large numbers of nodes. 
	-Problem of sorting the nodes in a manner that reveals underlying cluster structure is formally called seriation
-MATRIX VIEWS
	-Using color or saturation instead of text allows values associated with the links to be perceived more rapidly. 
	-Seriation problem applies just as much to the matrix view *
	-In matrix views, however, line crossings are impossible, quickly spot clusters and bridges. 
	-interactive grouping -':deeper exploration of network structure.*
